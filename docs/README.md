# Project Documentation

All project documentation is collected under this `docs/` directory and organized by topic.

Directories:

- `api/` - API reference and guides
- `database/` - Database optimization and schema notes
- `deployment/` - Docker and deployment guides
- `contributing/` - Contribution guidelines and developer setup
- `architecture/` - Architecture diagrams (ERD) and notes

Place documentation files in the appropriate subdirectory. The canonical ERD image should be placed at:

`docs/architecture/erd.png`

If you want me to move more documentation files into `docs/`, tell me which ones to move or I can move the rest automatically.
